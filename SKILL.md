# Gemini Goal Management Skill (gemini-goal)

**Goal-Driven Execution** is a framework that forces the AI agent to turn abstract user tasks into structured, verifiable long-term goals.

---

## ⚡ Slash Command Activation Rules (命令激活规则)

If the user prompt starts with or contains `/gemini-goal <objective>`:
1. **Immediate Setup**: You must IMMEDIATELY run:
   `python3 ~/.agents/skills/gemini-goal/scripts/goal.py create "<objective>"`
   to register the goal in the system state.
2. **Confirm Activation**: Acknowledge the goal initialization, display the goal summary, and present your requirement-by-requirement plan.
3. **Audit Execution**: Pursue this objective using the Plan-Act-Validate loop under the Completion Audit rules below.

## 🛠️ State Management Tools

This skill exposes local CLI tools to manage goal states via `~/.agents/skills/gemini-goal/scripts/goal.py`. 
You must execute these tools via `run_shell_command` when managing goal states:

1. **Create Goal**:
   `python3 ~/.agents/skills/gemini-goal/scripts/goal.py create "<objective>" [token_budget]`
   *Use only when explicitly requested to start a long-term goal. Do not create goals for simple queries.*

2. **Get Current Goal**:
   `python3 ~/.agents/skills/gemini-goal/scripts/goal.py get`
   *Use to check active goal requirements, elapsed progress, and current state.*

3. **Update Goal**:
   `python3 ~/.agents/skills/gemini-goal/scripts/goal.py update <complete|blocked|active> "[reason]" [token_increment]`
   *Use to mark goals complete or blocked according to strict audits.*

## 🔍 The Rigorous Completion Audit (完成审计准则)

Before calling `update_goal ... complete` to mark a goal as achieved, you **MUST** treat completion as unproven and perform a strict verification check against the actual current state:

1. **Derive Concrete Requirements**: Break down the overall objective into clear, testable, requirement-by-requirement items.
2. **Authorize Evidence Only**: Do not rely on "intent", "partial progress", "expected outputs", or "confidence". You must prove completion via **authoritative current-state evidence**:
   - Files exist and contain the correct content.
   - Local unit tests or builds pass successfully.
   - Command line verification yields correct exits.
3. **No Drive-by Assumptions**: The audit must prove absolute completion, not merely fail to find obvious remaining bugs.
4. **Conclusion**: Only mark complete once current evidence proves every requirement has been 100% satisfied.

---

## 🚨 The Blocked Audit (阻塞定义准则)

Do not call `update_goal ... blocked` the first time an error or blocker appears!

1. **The 3-Turn Try Principle (三击不中原则)**: You must attempt to solve the blocker using at least **3 consecutive turns of different strategies** (such as looking for different files, compiling with alternative flags, or fixing local environments via `env_doctor.py`).
2. **True Impasse**: Only set the status to `blocked` when you are at a complete dead-end and cannot make any progress without user-provided details or external state changes.
3. **Never Block on Difficulty**: Never mark a goal `blocked` merely because the task is slow, difficult, uncertain, or could benefit from some casual clarification.

## 🧭 Operational Workflow

```
[User Goal Request] 
       │
       ▼
1. Run "goal.py create '<goal>'" to initialize state.
       │
       ▼
2. Analyze context, break down requirements.
       │
       ▼
3. Work iteratively: Plan ➔ Act ➔ Validate (Loop).
       │
       ▼
4. Perform the Completion Audit (Verify files & tests).
       ├─────────────────────────────────┐
       ▼ (Pass)                          ▼ (Fail / Blocked)
5a. Run "goal.py update complete"   5b. Try 3 times. If still stuck,
    & report final status.              run "goal.py update blocked".
```
